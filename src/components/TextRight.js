        Health & Wellness offers an appointment-based medical clinic for all
        registered part-time and full-time students at Western and affiliated
        colleges. Urgent problems such as infections or injuries can often be
        seen the same day. Appointments can also be booked for non-urgent
        medical issues. Patients may see a physician of a specific gender and
        may also ask to see the same doctor for each visit.
